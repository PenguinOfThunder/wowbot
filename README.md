## Data Source

This bot gets data from the [Owen Wilson Wow API](https://owen-wilson-wow-api.herokuapp.com/) by Avi Mamenko. All credit for this goes to him. I just created the bot part.

## To-do

Add parameters to /wow command to allow more control of the response:

- results = _number_ - return a given number of random wows
- year _number_ - return wows from a specific year
- movie _string_ - return wows from a specific movie
- director _string_ - return wows from movies with a particular director.
- occurrence _number_ - return a wow by the number of its occurrence in the movie

Add more commands:

- /movies - return a list of all movies with wows
- /directors - return a list of all directors
