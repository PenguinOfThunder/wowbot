# Wowbot

Owen Wilson "Wow" Discord Bot.

Inspired by and powered by the [Owen Wilson Wow API](https://owen-wilson-wow-api.herokuapp.com/) (as seen on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31209924)).

The bot was built by following the [Discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin) and adapting it for Typescript.

Made for the fun of it and to learn more about writing Discord bots!
